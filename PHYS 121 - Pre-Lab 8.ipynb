    "For your $8^\\mathrm{th}$ and final lab, you will continue your investigations of the deep connections between electricity and magnetism by observing what happens when a strong permanent magnet slides down the length of a strip of copper. You'll be using a free software package called **Tracker** to quantitatively analyze video recordings of the magnet's motion. Tracker is equipped with an **auto-tracker** function that allows you to set up the software to automatically track the position of the object of interest - rather than manually clicking on the object for each frame of the video. This Pre-Lab is designed to show you how to use Tracker while reviewing the concepts of rotational motion and simple harmonic motion. \n",

    "The review of rotational/circular motion is timely because, as we'll see shortly in the PHYS 121 lectures, charged particles moving through a uniform magnetic field undergo circular motion.  In fact, the aurora borealis or northern lights, involve charged particles (that originate from the upper atmosphere of the sun) spiralling around the magnetic field lines of the Earth.  For anyone interested, <a href = \"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atmos/aurora.html\">HyperPhysics</a> has a nice introduction to the physics of aurora. \n",

This creates a 'Template' that the software searches for and tracks as the video advances.  You can expand the size of circle to make a larger 'Template' image.

    "1. Increase the size of the *template boundary*.  We have found that the tracking is more reliable if the size of this circle is increased such that it contains most of the toonie.  This method probably works well because of the high contrast between the toonie and the vinyl record.\n",
    "2. Because the toonie is relatively far from the rotation axis, its undergoes a large displacement each time the video advances by a frame.  Increase the size of the *search window* (i.e. the box surrounding the template boundary) to ensure that Tracker will still be able to find the toonie as the video advances.\n",

    "\n",
    "You've hopefully seen that, even though the oscillations of the $x$-positons for **mass A** and **mass B** have very different amplitudes (nearly a fuctor of two difference), the oscillation periods are nearly identical.  An oscillation period that is independent of the oscillation amplitude is one of the signatures of simple harmonic motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The $x$- and $y$-positions of an object undergoing uniform circular motion are examples of simple harmonic motion.  The simple pendulum that we studied in Labs #1 and 2 exhibited an osicllation period that had a weak, but detectable, dependence on the oscillation amplitude.  Therefore, the pendulum only *approximates* simple harmonic motion.  Recall that, when analyzing the simple pendulum, we made the simplifying approximation that $\\sin\\theta\\approx\\theta$.  For small angles ($\\theta<15^\\circ$), this approximation is very good and the pendulum very closely approximates a simple harmonic oscillator.  However, the approximation begins to break down for larger angles and the amplitude-dependent oscillation period reveals itself."
